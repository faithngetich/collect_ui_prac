        <p>People who ask confidently get more than those who are hesitant and uncertain. When you've figured out
            what you want to ask for, do it with certainty, boldness and confidence. Don't be shy or feel intimidated by the experience. 
            You may face some unexpected criticism, but be prepared for it with confidence. (Jack Canfield)

        <p>It is better by noble boldness to run the risk of being subject to half the evils we anticipate than to remain in cowardly
            listlessness for fear of what might happen. Herodotus

            Boldness is a mask for fear, however great.
            I don't mean to offend anybody, but I think that we get a lot of scientists now who are bent into a system,
            and we lose some of their boldness by that. Obviously, you have to learn the ropes, 
            but I think it's important to do that without hammering out the radicalness that makes innovation happen.
